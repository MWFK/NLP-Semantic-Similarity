It contains many state-of-the-art pretrained models that are fine-tuned for various applications. One of the primary tasks that it supports is Semantic Textual Similarity, which is the one we will focus on in this post.\n",

As discussed in the introduction, the approach is to use the model to encode the two sentences, and then calculating the cosine similarity of the resulting two embeddings. The final result will be the semantic similarity score.\n",
        "\n",
        "In general, we can use different formulas to calculate the final similarity score (e.g. dot product, Jaccard, etc.), but in this case, we are using cosine similarity due to its properties. The more important factor is the embeddings, which is produced by the model, so it is important to use a decent encoding model."
