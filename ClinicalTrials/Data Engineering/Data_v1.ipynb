       " \"|All individuals with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of lung cancer or a family of lung cancer are eligible to enroll their family in the study. Five major histologic types of lung cancer, i.e., adenocardinoma, squamous cell, small cell, large cell, and unspecified nonsmall cell carcinoma will be included. In addition to lung cancer patients, LSU will also contact patients newly diagnosed with bronchus or tracheal cancer in target hospital areas to request their enrollment in their study. In addition, several sites including LSU, Mayo Clinic and Karmanos Cancer Institute also collect DNA samples from unaffected, geographically and ethnically matched controls.||For the purposes of this study, an eligible family must meet the minimum criteria for familial lung cancer: at least 2 first-degree relatives in the family have had lung cancer. Priority will be given to more highly loaded pedigrees and to families in which the affected persons had onset of the disease at an early age (less than 50 years). Lung cancer cases may be living or deceased. Relatives with lung cancer are defined as first- o second-degree relatives or cousins of index cases will be eligible to participate in the study because their familial relationships might provide useful linkage information.||Adult participants must be physically able to tolerate removal of 25 to 40 ml of blood, or buccal brush sampling of their cheek. Children above 5 years old must be able to physically tolerate an amount of blood drawn that is equal to 4ml/kg of their weight. Adults must be willing to complete a self-administered environmental exposure questionnaire, and all participants must be able to consent to the study procedures (or have appropriate assent/parental consent). Biological specimens, including blood samples, archived tumor blocks and other medical records will be obtained from patients treated at the various hospitals and collection sites and from individuals with strong family history of lung cancer (either affected or unaffected) who have either been self-referred or physician referred to the study.||EXCLUSION CRITERIA:||Excluded from the study are families or individuals within the family who do not meet the minimum criteria described above. Individuals who do not sign the Consent Form will be excluded, and families for whom all necessary members do not sign the Consent Form may be excluded. MAYO also excludes patients who (1) do not speak English, (2) are non-US citizens or residents and (3) are diagnosed with an uncommon tumor type that is not among the above specified types (e.g.) mixed cell or unspecified non-small cell lung cancer, carcinoids, sarcomas and lymphomas of the lung and bronchus). This is done at MAYO because the family study is piggy-backed onto a case-control study. No fetuses, prisoners or institutionalized individuals will be enrolled. While this study does not target pregnant women, because contact with many of the families will be by mail we will not be able to exclude pregnant women. Additionally, the participant's own physician or health care clinic will draw blood samples from long-distance participants and therefore can determine if there is any risk to the woman or her fetus.

       " \"All individuals with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of lung cancer or a family of lung cancer are eligible to enroll their family in the study. Five major histologic types of lung cancer, i.e., adenocardinoma, squamous cell, small cell, large cell, and unspecified nonsmall cell carcinoma will be included. In addition to lung cancer patients, LSU will also contact patients newly diagnosed with bronchus or tracheal cancer in target hospital areas to request their enrollment in their study. In addition, several sites including LSU, Mayo Clinic and Karmanos Cancer Institute also collect DNA samples from unaffected, geographically and ethnically matched controls.||For the purposes of this study, an eligible family must meet the minimum criteria for familial lung cancer: at least 2 first-degree relatives in the family have had lung cancer. Priority will be given to more highly loaded pedigrees and to families in which the affected persons had onset of the disease at an early age (less than 50 years). Lung cancer cases may be living or deceased. Relatives with lung cancer are defined as first- o second-degree relatives or cousins of index cases will be eligible to participate in the study because their familial relationships might provide useful linkage information.||Adult participants must be physically able to tolerate removal of 25 to 40 ml of blood, or buccal brush sampling of their cheek. Children above 5 years old must be able to physically tolerate an amount of blood drawn that is equal to 4ml/kg of their weight. Adults must be willing to complete a self-administered environmental exposure questionnaire, and all participants must be able to consent to the study procedures (or have appropriate assent/parental consent). Biological specimens, including blood samples, archived tumor blocks and other medical records will be obtained from patients treated at the various hospitals and collection sites and from individuals with strong family history of lung cancer (either affected or unaffected) who have either been self-referred or physician referred to the study.||EXCLUSION CRITERIA:||Excluded from the study are families or individuals within the family who do not meet the minimum criteria described above. Individuals who do not sign the Consent Form will be excluded, and families for whom all necessary members do not sign the Consent Form may be excluded. MAYO also excludes patients who (1) do not speak English, (2) are non-US citizens or residents and (3) are diagnosed with an uncommon tumor type that is not among the above specified types (e.g.) mixed cell or unspecified non-small cell lung cancer, carcinoids, sarcomas and lymphomas of the lung and bronchus). This is done at MAYO because the family study is piggy-backed onto a case-control study. No fetuses, prisoners or institutionalized individuals will be enrolled. While this study does not target pregnant women, because contact with many of the families will be by mail we will not be able to exclude pregnant women. Additionally, the participant's own physician or health care clinic will draw blood samples from long-distance participants and therefore can determine if there is any risk to the woman or her fetus. UMHS also excludes children as research participants in their site\",\n",

These include: S-metoprolol, propafenone, timolol, amitriptyline, clomipramine, desipramine, imipramine, paroxetine, haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine, codeine, flecainide, mexilletine, tamoxifen, venlafaxine. Lidocaine may be used with clinical monitoring (including telemetry). Opiates such as morphine, oxycodone, dihydrocodeine, hydrocodone, and tramadol can be used as substitutes to replace codeine. Use of these opiates should be monitored for altered analgesia during treatment with PF-804 as they may be partly metabolized by CYP2D6. If PF-804 is administered with drugs which are P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates and have a narrow therapeutic index, monitoring for exaggerated effect and/or toxicities is recommended.|Pregnancy or inadequate contraception.
